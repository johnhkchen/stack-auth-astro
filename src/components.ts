/**
 * React component re-exports from Stack Auth UI
 * 
 * This module re-exports Stack Auth's React components for use in Astro
 * with proper TypeScript support, component hydration, and development-time
 * prop validation.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Complete TypeScript prop autocompletion
 * - Astro island hydration compatibility  
 * - Full Stack Auth component functionality
 * - Enhanced error handling and validation
 * 
 * Usage in Astro:
 * ```astro
 * ---
 * import { SignIn, UserButton, SignUp } from 'astro-stack-auth/components';
 * ---
 * 
 * <SignIn client:load extraInfo="Welcome!" firstTab="password" />
 * <UserButton client:visible showUserInfo={true} />
 * <SignUp client:idle noPasswordRepeat={false} />
 * ```
