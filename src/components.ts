/**
 * React component re-exports from Stack Auth UI
 * 
 * This module re-exports Stack Auth's React components for use in Astro
 * with proper TypeScript support, component hydration, and development-time
 * prop validation.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: REST API Migration Status
 * ==========================================
 * We've migrated all authentication logic to use Stack Auth's REST API directly
 * to eliminate Next.js coupling issues. However, we still import UI components
 * from @stackframe/stack because:
 * 
 * 1. The UI components (SignIn, SignUp, UserButton, etc.) are bundled with the SDK
 * 2. These components work correctly in the browser environment
 * 3. We use our custom StackProvider for state management instead of the SDK's
 * 
 * The SDK is ONLY used for importing pre-built UI components. All auth logic
 * uses our REST API client in src/rest-api/client.ts.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Complete TypeScript prop autocompletion
 * - Astro island hydration compatibility  
 * - Full Stack Auth component functionality
 * - Enhanced error handling and validation
 * 
 * Usage in Astro:
 * ```astro
 * ---
 * import { SignIn, UserButton, SignUp } from 'astro-stack-auth/components';
 * ---
 * 
 * <SignIn client:load extraInfo="Welcome!" firstTab="password" />
 * <UserButton client:visible showUserInfo={true} />
 * <SignUp client:idle noPasswordRepeat={false} />
 * ```

/**
 * Comprehensive Stack Auth component integration for Astro

 * All components support:
 * ✅ Full TypeScript autocompletion with extracted props
 * ✅ All Astro hydration strategies (client:load, client:idle, client:visible, etc.)
 * ✅ Complete Stack Auth functionality including OAuth, magic links, and sessions
 * ✅ Advanced customization through extraInfo, showUserInfo, and other props
 * ✅ Error handling with StackAuthClientError and CLIENT_ERROR_CODES
 * ✅ Mock support for development and testing
 * ✅ Internationalization support via StackProvider lang prop
