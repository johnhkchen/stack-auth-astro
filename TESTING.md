# Testing Stack Auth Integration Builds

This document explains the testing approach for Stack Auth integration builds, specifically how to build and test the integration when Stack Auth environment variables are not available (such as in CI/CD environments).

## Problem

During development and CI/CD, the Stack Auth integration requires three environment variables to be set:
- `STACK_PROJECT_ID`
- `STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`

Without these variables, builds would fail with configuration validation errors, preventing proper testing of the integration itself.

## Solution

We've implemented a test mode system that allows builds to proceed with mock Stack Auth environment variables while maintaining security for production builds.

### Test Environment Files

Both example projects now include `.env.test` files with mock environment variables:

```bash
# examples/minimal-astro/.env.test
# examples/full-featured/.env.test
STACK_PROJECT_ID=test_project_id_12345
STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=pk_test_mockkey123456789abcdef
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=sk_test_mocksecret123456789abcdef
STACK_AUTH_PREFIX=/handler
NODE_ENV=test
```

### Test Build Scripts

Each example project includes a `build:test` script that:
1. Sets mock Stack Auth environment variables
2. Enables test mode via `STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true`
3. Runs the normal build process

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:test": "STACK_PROJECT_ID=test_project_id_12345 STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=pk_test_mockkey123456789abcdef STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=sk_test_mocksecret123456789abcdef STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true npm run build"
  }
}
```

### Configuration

The Astro configuration conditionally enables `skipValidation` based on the test mode:

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    stackAuth({
      // Skip validation during test builds until Sprint 002 features are implemented
      skipValidation: process.env.STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE === 'true'
    })
  ]
});
```

## Usage

### Local Development Testing

To test an example project build locally:

```bash
cd examples/minimal-astro
npm run build:test
```

or

```bash
cd examples/full-featured
npm run build:test
```

### CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow includes an `example-build-tests` job that:
- Tests both example projects
- Uses multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
- Validates that builds complete successfully with mock environment variables
- Archives build artifacts if tests fail

### Production vs Test Mode

| Environment | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **Production** (`STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE` not set) | Requires real Stack Auth environment variables, full validation enabled |
| **Test** (`STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true`) | Uses mock environment variables, validation skipped for missing Sprint 002 features |

## Security Considerations

1. **Mock values are clearly marked**: All test environment variables use obviously fake values that cannot be mistaken for production credentials
2. **Production safety**: Production builds still require real environment variables when test mode is disabled
3. **No real credentials in code**: Test environment files contain only mock values and are safe to commit

## Sprint 002 Migration

When Sprint 002 features (API handler and middleware) are implemented:
- Test mode will no longer need to skip validation
- The integration will validate both environment variables AND implementation completeness
- Test builds will exercise the full authentication flow with mock data

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Valid Test Build
```bash
STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true npm run build:test
```

### Production Build (should fail without real env vars)
```bash
npm run build
```

### Custom Test Configuration
```bash
STACK_PROJECT_ID=custom_test_id \
STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=pk_custom_test \
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=sk_custom_test \
STACK_AUTH_TEST_MODE=true \
npm run build
```

This testing approach ensures that:
1. ✅ CI/CD builds can validate the integration structure
2. ✅ Production builds maintain security requirements  
3. ✅ Development teams can test locally without Stack Auth accounts
4. ✅ The integration is thoroughly tested in multiple environments
